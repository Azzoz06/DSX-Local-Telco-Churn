# DSX Local Hands-on lab

## About Projects
Each .zip file contains DSX Local sample notebooks and data. 

## Setting up projects in DSX Local
1. Download the zip files. Do not unzip them, but rename the zip file to a unique name, for example, add your initials. 
   *Note: Project names in DSX Local cluster must be unique. When we create a project "from file", the project name is inherited from the file name* 
2. Log in to DSX Local
3. Select "Create New Project" and select "From File"
4. Browse to the .zip file
5. After the project has been imported, open the notebook and run through it.
